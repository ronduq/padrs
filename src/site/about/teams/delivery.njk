      <p class="intro">We run an advanced digital delivery practice – agile, light, iterative and transparent – in a learning culture. We deliver in a modern, flexible way; imagining, designing, building and integrating beautifully useful services into the systems they’re powered by, using repeatable patterns and established agile practices to drive and measure value. We tailor our delivery approaches to the client and project needs to ensure the best outcomes and our teams are empowered to make choices about how they work and to establish their routines together.</p>

          <h2 class="h3">Delivery at pace</h2>
          <p>Our delivery managers help teams form and deliver quickly and iteratively to demonstrate the value of user-centred design and agile delivery by doing. As we work, we help our clients map and close the gap between their current and target state technology stack, governance processes, development and delivery approaches, digital skills and training as well as operational workflows and processes.</p>

          <p>We help our clients identify and adopt new delivery tools and techniques, and the interlocking artefacts and deliverables needed throughout product development lifecycles. We consult on, define and document delivery toolkits - and guide our clients in how to on-board new team members, agile mindsets and behaviours or delivery practices as they scale.

          <h2 class="h3">Robust governance </h2>
          <p>A clear set of accurate metrics, ideally live, or regularly produced and visible to all, allows the whole team to understand how a project or product is stacking up against agreed commercial, scheduling and performance indicators. The delivery team ensure governance is robust, risks are managed, and teams are unhindered in their efforts. We provide senior coaching in the management and governance of agile delivery projects and teams and we advise our clients on digital team shapes and structures – helping to develop skills matrices, job descriptions, and recruitment strategies</p>
