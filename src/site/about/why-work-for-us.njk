      <h3 class="h4">Moving on up </h4>
      <p>We know it can be important to understand how you progress at a company – whether it’s a priority or something you want to take your time over. </p>
      <p>Depending on your role, it’s fairly common at PA to have both an internal PA rank (like ‘Principal Consultant’), as well as a practitioner job title (such as ‘Senior Designer’). We’ve explained what these ranks mean below. Over time your performance and growing skillset will enable you to move up to the next rank (and possibly change your job title, too). You can find out how this affects you specifically at interview.</p>

      <p>Successful businesses are inclusive and diverse. They’re businesses where people of any age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic group or ability are given the opportunity to bring their true self to work and excel in what they do. At PA, inclusion and diversity is of the utmost importance to us. It fuels our creativity, enabling us to live our Purpose, ‘Bringing Ingenuity to Life,’ and it matters to our people and to our clients. We’re always listening and learning and looking for ways to create an ever more inclusive and diverse place to work, where we all feel supported and can be ourselves.</p>
