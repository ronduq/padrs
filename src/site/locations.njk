        <p class="col-lg-8 col-12 intro">The nature of digital working – especially now – is that we should be able to deliver fantastic work from anywhere. And we do. That said, we also love collaborating face-to-face (and lunch-to-lunch) with our colleagues and clients, too. As such, we have four Digital office ‘hubs’, with client onsite working and remote working alongside that. Some of our colleagues are also based out of other lovely PA offices, too, spreading the Digital love.</p>

There are lots of sofas, a good few project rooms and plenty of windows, encouraging collaborative, positive vibes. We’re a short hop from our friends in the Victoria office and some of the best food and drink in London.</p>

There’s lots of communal space – whether you want to get your head down quietly or spread out with your team. Just be careful you don’t lose 30 minutes gazing out the window at the incredible view. Being home to around 130 technologists, data analysts, researchers, consultants and more, it’s a great place to meet colleagues working on all sorts of fascinating projects.</p>

      <h2 class="h4">Working client-side</h2>
      <p class="grey">Depending on the project you’re working on, you may also get the chance to work in different locations. Usually this will be onsite at your client’s office, and sometimes this will be in one of our other PA offices – such as Cambridge, Bristol, New York or Oslo.</p>
      <p class="grey">Rest assured, whenever a project would require you to work away from your base office, you’ll always have the chance to discuss this with your manager first, so we know what you’re happy with. We want you to love your job – we’re not going to send you hours away from your family (unless you want us to...).</p>

      <h2 class="h4">Remote working</h2>
      <p class="grey">We have always been open to discussions about remote working and have usually addressed this on a case by case basis. However, in the current climate of course nearly all of our staff are working (brilliantly and effectively) from home. We have all of the necessary tools in place to do this – from conference calling to collaborative workshop programmes – and will continue to adapt as the situation evolves.</p>
