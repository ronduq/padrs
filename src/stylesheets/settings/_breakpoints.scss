/// Map of breakpoints to be used in the `respond-to` mixin. These will generally match common device sizes. Any breakpoint in this list should be considered globally-available. If you need per-component "tweakpoints", create a `$tweakpoints` map inside your component Sass file rather than adding to the global breakpoints map.
/// @type Map
$breakpoints: (
  'tablet': 800px,
  'mobile': 480px
